MarqueeMe
=========

This is the dumbest thing I have created, including the <a href="https://github.com/ByzantineFailure/SsAndGs/tree/master/Read-maybe%20Hashtable">Read-Maybe hashtable</a>.

Basically this just takes the contents of a page and wraps it in marquee tags, styling be damned.

Now with True 90s Mode which makes it blink too because sure why not.

Also includes Malicious Mode, which removes the context item and makes it happen on 15% of page loads.

You can activate it via the context menu.
