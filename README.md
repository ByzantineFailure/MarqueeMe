MarqueeMe
=========

This is the dumbest thing I have created, including the <a href="https://github.com/ByzantineFailure/SsAndGs/tree/master/Read-maybe%20Hashtable">Read-Maybe hashtable</a>.

Basically this just takes the contents of a page and wraps it in marquee tags, styling be damned.

You can activate it via the context menu.
